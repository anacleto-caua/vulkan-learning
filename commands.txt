Clean the build directory:
rm -rf build

Configure the project (for Debug build):
cmake -S . -B build

Configure the project (for Release build):
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Build the project:
cmake --build build

Run the executable (after configuring and building):
cmake --build build --target run

One-liner to clean, configure for Debug, build, and run:
rm -rf build && cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug && cmake --build build && ./build/bin/learning
(Note: This last command assumes the executable is named learning and is placed in build/bin.)

"Error: could not load cache"
rm -rf build
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build     # This configures for a Debug build by default
cmake --build build

    OR
    
rm -rf build && mkdir build && cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build
